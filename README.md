# Terraform repo: GCP infrastructure

Infrastructure as Code for the challenge: creates the Google Cloud project, the
BigQuery datasets dbt writes to, the service account dbt runs as and the keyless
GitHub Actions to GCP authentication.

## Role in the data pipeline

This repo builds the landing zone and identity layer that the
[`dbt_repo`](../dbt_repo/README.md) transformations run on top of. Concretely, it sets up:

- **Where data lands**: two BigQuery datasets, `staging` and `mart`, that dbt
  materialises its models into.
- **Who moves the data**: a least-privilege `dbt-runner` service account that can
  run BigQuery jobs (to read the public source) and write only to those two datasets.
- **How CI authenticates**: Workload Identity Federation so GitHub Actions can act
  as that service account with no downloaded key, plus the repo secrets/variables
  dbt's CI needs.

## What it provisions

| File | Resource(s) |
|------|-------------|
| [`gcp_project.tf`](gcp_project.tf) | The GCP project `blockchain-cash-analysis`. |
| [`services.tf`](services.tf) | Enables the required APIs (BigQuery, IAM, IAM Credentials, STS, Cloud Resource Manager). |
| [`bigquery.tf`](bigquery.tf) | The `staging` and `mart` BigQuery datasets. |
| [`IAM.tf`](IAM.tf) | The `dbt-runner` service account and least-privilege roles: `bigquery.jobUser` (project) and `bigquery.dataEditor` (scoped per dataset). |
| [`WIF.tf`](WIF.tf) | Workload Identity Pool + GitHub OIDC provider, locked to this repo: lets Actions impersonate the SA with no key. |
| [`github_actions.tf`](github_actions.tf) | Writes the WIF provider, SA email, project id and location into the dbt repo as Actions secrets & variables. |

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `gcp_project.tf` · `services.tf` · `bigquery.tf` · `IAM.tf` · `WIF.tf` · `github_actions.tf` | The resource files; see [What it provisions](#what-it-provisions). |
| [`providers.tf`](providers.tf) | Configures the `google` and `github` providers (region, GitHub owner/token). |
| [`variables.tf`](variables.tf) | Declares all input variables and the "at most one parent (org/folder)" validation. |
| [`terraform.tf`](terraform.tf) | Pins the Terraform version (≥ 1.10) and provider versions; documents the local state choice. |
| `terraform.tfvars` | Environment-specific values. Git-ignored; see [Configuration](#configuration). |
| [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) | Keeps state files, `.terraform/`, and `terraform.tfvars` out of version control. |
| [`.github/workflows/tf_ci.yml`](.github/workflows/tf_ci.yml) | PR CI — static validation only (`fmt -check`, `init -backend=false`, `validate`). |

## Prerequisites

- Terraform ≥ 1.10, gcloud, optional gh: `brew install terraform google-cloud-sdk gh`
- A GCP billing account and rights to create projects: `resourcemanager.projectCreator` on the org/folder and `roles/ billing.user` on the billing account.
- A GitHub fine-grained PAT scoped to the dbt repo (Secrets r/w, Variables r/w, Metadata r).
- `gcloud auth application-default login` so Terraform can act as you.

## Configuration

Inputs are not committed: `terraform.tfvars` is git-ignored, and the token is
env-only. Set them via a local `terraform.tfvars` and one env var:

**Required (no defaults):**

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `billing_account` | Billing account ID to link to the new project. |
| `quota_project_id` | An existing project, used only as the API/billing launchpad. |
| `github_owner` | GitHub user/org that owns the dbt repo. |
| `github_token` | Fine-grained PAT. Env var only. |
| `org_id` or `folder_id` | Where to create the project. Set exactly one, or neither for a personal account with no organisation. |

**Defaulted** (override only if needed): `staging_dataset_id=staging`,
`mart_dataset_id=mart`, `bigquery_location=US` (must match the public source),
`region=us-central1`, `dbt_service_account_id=dbt-runner`,
`dbt_repository=dbt_repo`, `workload_identity_pool_id=github-pool`. See
[`variables.tf`](variables.tf).

```bash
cat > terraform.tfvars <<'EOF'
billing_account  = "XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX"
quota_project_id = "your-launchpad-project"
github_owner     = "your-gh-user"
org_id           = "123456789012"   # OR folder_id, OR leave both null
folder_id        = null
EOF
read -rs TF_VAR_github_token && export TF_VAR_github_token   # keeps it out of shell history
```

## Deploy

The dbt repo must exist **before** the PAT (a fine-grained PAT is
scoped to an existing repo) and **before** `apply` (it writes secrets into that repo).

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login                      # 1. authenticate
gh repo create <owner>/dbt_repo --public                   # 2. create the dbt repo
read -rs TF_VAR_github_token && export TF_VAR_github_token  # 3. scoped PAT
#                                                            4. fill terraform.tfvars (above)
terraform init
terraform plan      # preview — creates nothing
terraform apply     # create everything
```

Validate only (no GCP/account needed):
`terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate`.

## State

Kept local (`terraform.tfstate`, git-ignored) for this single-environment
challenge so it is runnable with a plain `terraform init` and no bootstrap. Production would
use a remote GCS backend with state locking and per-environment isolation.

## CI

[`.github/workflows/tf_ci.yml`](.github/workflows/tf_ci.yml) runs `fmt -check`,
`init -backend=false`, and `validate` on pull requests; static checks only.
It never runs `plan`/`apply`, never loads state, and never authenticates to GCP
so a pull request changes nothing in the cloud.

**Why no apply-on-merge:** this config creates a project and links billing,
which needs org-level `projectCreator` + billing permissions, which are too privileged to
hand an automated pipeline. Provisioning is therefore a manual, local
`terraform apply`. A production GitOps setup would do plan-on-PR + apply-on-merge
with a remote backend and a dedicated least-privilege identity behind manual approval.

## Design choices

- **Keyless CI auth (WIF)**: no long-lived service-account JSON keys to leak or rotate.
- **Least privilege**: `jobUser` at project level; `dataEditor` only on the two owned datasets.
- **`auto_create_network = false`**: the default VPC isn't needed and widens the attack surface.
- **`US` BigQuery location**: must match the public source dataset (BigQuery can't join across locations).

## Additional comments

> The GCP `project_id` must be globally unique across all of GCP. The
> default `blockchain-cash-analysis` is already in use, so anyone reproducing this
> must set their own unique project ID.
